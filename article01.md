This is a written article, showing us how financial illetaracy (whether personal or business) proves to be ecologically deficient.

Lets start by mentioning how our approach in finance currently operates:
	- We usually have a digital bank account, contents of which are only visible to us through numbers on a digital screen
	- When investing, we tend to choose extreme-options such as crypto-currencies and start-ups as our initial investment, rather than secure options at a local bank/advisory
	- When choosing automotive options, we tend to go all-out and get the maximum that's possible for us, in terms of borrowing, usually being inconsiderate with interest rates and future payout goals


The problem with this, if not obvious already, is that we don't create fail-safes and rely on mandatory insurance-compliance laws for a safety net on rainy days

How do we address this?
By talking to real-entities online/in person at a bank-of-choice. Financial advisors working at our local banks, provide a framework from a third-person point of view(POV).
By doing so, we rid our dependence on Meta/X/etc in controlling how our money flows throughout an economical landscape

Ensuring trust in institutions, paves way for our children and thiers, to self-educate on Mother Earth while being responsible of one's own actions
